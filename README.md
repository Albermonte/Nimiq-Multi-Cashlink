## How does it work?

Thanks to the incredible technology provided by [Nimiq](https://www.nimiq.com/) we can have a cryptocurrency node and wallet in your own browser. This allows us to make a wallet for you on your first visit to the [Multi Cashlink website](https://cashlinks.shortnim.me/) and store it for your next visit.

### Now, how can we create a cashlink with only one transaction?

Easy, we request a transaction to fill the wallet inside the [Multi Cashlink website](https://cashlinks.shortnim.me/) and then [create](https://github.com/Albermonte/Nimiq-Multi-Cashlink/blob/740887e6250edfce7a5d55fb03086b65ecab6068/src/services/Nimiq.ts#L115) as many cashlinks as you want (up to 500).
Once we have the NIM on the website wallet it's just a [Nimiq Extended Transaction](https://github.com/Albermonte/Nimiq-Multi-Cashlink/blob/740887e6250edfce7a5d55fb03086b65ecab6068/src/services/Nimiq.ts#L157) and all done, all your Cashlinks are ready to share.

We also store all of your Cashlinks using [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) to have an history and keep track of Funded and Claimed Cashlinks. This also allows you to claim unclaimed Cashlinks with just one click.

And that's all, have fun ðŸ˜„
